## #About me

I’m Nusratov Jahongir, a fullstack web developer and freelancer from Bukhara with over 2 years of professional experience. My main expertise is in React and Next.js, including server-side rendering, and I have strong skills in TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN, Ant Design, and Material-UI. I also work with Node.js, PostgreSQL, Firebase, and API integrations, building scalable applications from frontend to backend.

Beyond coding, I enjoy solving algorithmic challenges on LeetCode, working with databases, and building Telegram bots for automation, education, and business workflows. I’m passionate about creating efficient, user-friendly applications and continuously learning to expand my expertise.
